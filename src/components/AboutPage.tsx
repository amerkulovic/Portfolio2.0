        Hello, my name is Amer. I am a software engineer with a background in business and technology. I am passionate about coding, along with my freelance work, I love creating personal projects to help me grow as a developer. Over the years, I have learned a great deal and can create full-stack projects. My experience as a freelance software engineer has taught me a lot, which has been immensely helpful in this profession. I volunteer for non-profits and help them with their website
